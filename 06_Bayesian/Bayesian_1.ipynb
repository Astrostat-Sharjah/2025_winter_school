While simple, a uniform prior for $\\theta$ is not uniform for a non-linear transformation of $\\theta$ (e.g., $\\theta^2$).\n",

    "## 3.2. Likelihood $P(\\text{data} | \\text{hypothesis}, I)$\n",
    "The <span style=\"color:#d87c3a\">likelihood function</span>, $P(\\text{data} | \\text{hypothesis}, I)$, is the cornerstone that <span style=\"color:#d87c3a\">connects our observed data to the parameters of our hypothesis</span>. If the data are very probable under the hypothesis, the likelihood is high. If the data are improbable, the likelihood is low. For many problems, we assume a specific mathematical form for the likelihood. Choosing an appropriate likelihood is crucial as it <span style=\"color:#d87c3a\">encapsulates our assumptions about the data-generating process</span>. The form of the likelihood is <span style=\"color:#d87c3a\">determined by the nature of the data and the underlying physical or statistical model</span> we believe is responsible for producing that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Choose a Likelihood:\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice primarily depends on:\n",
    "1.  **Type of Data**: Is the data continuous (e.g., measurements of temperature, flux), discrete counts (e.g., number of photons, detected events), binary (e.g., success/failure), or categorical?\n",
    "2.  **Assumed Data-Generating Process**: What statistical distribution best describes the variability or noise in the data, given a set of model parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Likelihood Functions and Their Use Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some commonly used likelihood functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Gaussian (Normal) Likelihood**:\n",
    "    *   **Use Case**: For <span style=\"color:#d87c3a\">continuous data</span> that are expected to be <span style=\"color:#d87c3a\">symmetrically distributed</span> around a mean value, or when the <span style=\"color:#d87c3a\">errors are assumed to be normally distributed</span> (often invoked by the Central Limit Theorem).\n",
    "    *   **Example**: Measuring the brightness of a star, where instrumental noise and other random errors lead to Gaussian fluctuations around the true brightness.\n",
    "    *   **Form**: If we have $N$ data points $x_i$, and our hypothesis is that they are drawn from a Gaussian with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ (where $\\mu$ and/or $\\sigma$ could be our parameters):\n",
    "        $$ P(\\{x_i\\} | \\mu, \\sigma, I) = \\prod_{i=1}^N \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x_i-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Poisson Likelihood**:\n",
    "    *   **Use Case**: For <span style=\"color:#d87c3a\">count data</span>, representing the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, assuming events are <span style=\"color:#d87c3a\">independent</span> and occur at a <span style=\"color:#d87c3a\">constant average rate</span>.\n",
    "    *   **Example**: Counting the number of X-ray photons ($k$) detected from a celestial source in a given observation time, where the expected mean count is $\\lambda$. This is the primary example in this notebook.\n",
    "    *   **Form**: If we observe $k$ counts and the expected mean is $\\lambda$:\n",
    "        $$ P(k | \\lambda, I) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Binomial Likelihood**:\n",
    "    *   **Use Case**: For data representing the <span style=\"color:#d87c3a\">number of \"successes\"</span> ($k$) <span style=\"color:#d87c3a\">in a fixed number of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials</span>, where each trial has a probability $p$ of success.\n",
    "    *   **Example**: Determining the probability $p$ that a galaxy is a spiral type, given that we observed $k$ spiral galaxies in a sample of $n$ galaxies.\n",
    "    *   **Form**:\n",
    "        $$ P(k | n, p, I) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Exponential Likelihood**:\n",
    "    *   **Use Case**: For modeling <span style=\"color:#d87c3a\">positive, continuous data</span>, often representing waiting times between events in a Poisson process, or the decay rate of a particle.\n",
    "    *   **Example**: Modeling the time intervals between successive detections of high-energy cosmic rays, assuming they arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$. The likelihood for an observed interval $t$ is $P(t | \\lambda, I) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda t}$.\n",
    "    *   **Form** (for a single data point $x$ with rate parameter $\\lambda$ or scale parameter $\\beta=1/\\lambda$):\n",
    "        $$ P(x | \\lambda, I) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad P(x | \\beta, I) = \\frac{1}{\\beta} e^{-x/\\beta} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Uniform Likelihood**:\n",
    "    *   **Use Case**: When, given the hypothesis, <span style=\"color:#d87c3a\">any data value</span> within a specific range $[a,b]$ is considered <span style=\"color:#d87c3a\">equally probable</span>, and values outside this range are impossible.\n",
    "    *   **Example**: If a model predicts a signal must lie between $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$, and we have no reason to prefer any value within this range over another.\n",
    "    *   **Form**: For a data point $x$:\n",
    "        $$ P(x | \\theta_1, \\theta_2, I) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{\\theta_2 - \\theta_1} & \\text{if } \\theta_1 \\le x \\le \\theta_2 \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constructing a Likelihood:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Based on Physical Models**: Often, the likelihood is derived from a physical model of the measurement process. For instance, if your instrument has a known response function, this function will inform the likelihood.\n",
    "*   **Combining Distributions**: More complex likelihoods can be built by combining simpler ones, e.g., a mixture model if data can arise from different processes, or a convolution if there are multiple sources of error.\n",
    "*   **Numerical Likelihoods**: If an analytical form is intractable, the likelihood might be evaluated numerically based on simulations of the data-generating process for different parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The likelihood is a function of the **parameters** of your hypothesis, for the **fixed, observed data**.\n",
    "*   The choice of likelihood is a modeling choice and should be justified. If the assumptions underlying the chosen likelihood are strongly violated by the data-generating process, the Bayesian inference results may be misleading.\n",
    "*   Sometimes, robust likelihoods (e.g., Student's t-distribution instead of Gaussian for data with heavy tails) are used to make inferences less sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and correctly specifying the likelihood is arguably the most critical step in a Bayesian (and frequentist) analysis, as it defines how the data inform our beliefs about the hypotheses."

    "# 6. Bayesian Credible Regions (or Intervals)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the posterior probability distribution $P(\\text{hypothesis} | \\text{data}, I)$, which tells us the probability of different parameter values (our hypothesis) given the data, we often want to summarize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Point Estimates**: We might report the **Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)** value (the mode of the posterior), the **mean**, or the **median** of the posterior distribution as a single best guess for our parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Credible Regions**: More comprehensively, we define a **credible region** (or credible interval for a single parameter) that contains a certain amount of the posterior probability, for example, 90% or 95%.\n",
    "    *   A $X\\%$ credible region is an interval $[a, b]$ such that $\\int_a^b P(\\text{parameter} | \\text{data}, I) d(\\text{parameter}) = X/100$.\n",
    "    *   **Interpretation**: A $X\\%$ credible region means there is a $X\\%$ probability that the true value of the parameter lies within that interval, given our data and model. This is a direct statement about the parameter's location.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crucial Distinction: Credible Regions vs. Frequentist Confidence Intervals**\n",
    "\n",
    "This interpretation is fundamentally different from a frequentist confidence interval:\n",
    "*   A **Bayesian $X\\%$ credible region** is a statement about the probability of the parameter's value, given the observed data. The interval is fixed, and we assign a probability to the parameter being in it.\n",
    "*   A **frequentist $X\\%$ confidence interval** is constructed such that if we were to repeat the experiment many times, $X\\%$ of such *calculated intervals* would contain the true, fixed parameter value. It's a statement about the long-run performance of the interval construction procedure, not directly about the probability of the parameter lying in a *specific, calculated* interval from our single dataset.\n",
    "For scientists interpreting a single experiment, the Bayesian credible region often aligns more intuitively with the question: \\\"How likely is the parameter to be in this range, based on my data?\\\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Credible Regions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Credible regions are not unique. For a given probability level (e.g., 90%), common ways to define the interval include:\n",
    "*   **Equal-Tailed Interval (or Central Credible Interval)**: This interval is defined by cutting off $(100-X)/2\\%$ of the probability from each tail of the posterior distribution. For example, a 90% equal-tailed interval excludes 5% from the lower tail and 5% from the upper tail. This is often easy to compute.\n",
    "*   **Highest Posterior Density (HPD) Interval**: This interval is constructed such that all points inside it have a higher posterior probability density than any point outside it. It is the shortest possible interval containing $X\\%$ of the probability. While conceptually useful, it can be more complex to calculate, especially for asymmetric or multimodal posteriors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity in our example, we will focus on the equal-tailed interval."

    "# 7. Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hierarchical Bayesian modeling** (HBM) is one of the most powerful tools in the Bayesian toolbox. At its core, it’s a structured way of doing inference when your data comes from multiple sources, levels, or populations — and you want to model both the *individual units* and their *shared structure*.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes it “hierarchical” is that **you don’t just place priors on parameters — you also place priors on the priors**. That is, the *parameters of your prior distributions* (called **hyperparameters**) are also inferred from the data. And those get their own priors, called **hyperpriors**. The result is a **multi-level model**, where inference flows both bottom-up and top-down.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A motivating example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we measure the brightness of $N$ different stars, each with multiple noisy observations. The natural hierarchy here looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Level 1 (Data):**\n",
    "   $m_{ij}$ is the apparent magnitude of star $i$ in observation $j$ — this is what we actually measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Level 2 (Latent object parameters):**\n",
    "   Each star $i$ has a true magnitude $M_i$, which we can’t observe directly, but infer from the noisy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Level 3 (Population hyperparameters):**\n",
    "   We assume that the true magnitudes $M_i$ are drawn from a population distribution with unknown mean $\\mu_M$ and scatter $\\sigma_M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives rise to the following generative model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "M_i &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_M, \\sigma_M^2), \\\\\\\\\n",
    "m_{ij} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(M_i, \\sigma_{\\text{photon}}^2),\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with **priors** on the hyperparameters, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mu_M \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 10^2)$,\n",
    "* $\\sigma_M \\sim \\text{Half-Cauchy}(0, 5)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We fit all the layers *simultaneously* using Bayesian inference (e.g., MCMC or variational methods). After inference, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a posterior for each star’s true brightness $M_i$, and\n",
    "* a posterior for the population parameters $(\\mu_M, \\sigma_M)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simultaneous inference allows information to *flow between stars*: a noisy or poorly measured star can “borrow strength” from the better-measured population.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical modeling isn’t just fancy terminology — it brings several concrete advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Sharing statistical strength**\n",
    "\n",
    "In classic Bayesian models, we treat each object separately. But if we think that objects come from a shared distribution (like all stars belonging to a stellar population), then it makes sense to infer them *jointly*. This enables “partial pooling” — each object's parameter estimate is pulled toward the population mean, especially when its data is weak.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Example*: A star with only one noisy brightness measurement will still get a reasonable estimate of its true magnitude, informed by what we learned from the other stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Capturing complex structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical models let us **separate individual variability from population-level structure**, allowing us to answer both specific and global questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the true brightness of star 27?\n",
    "* What is the overall distribution of star magnitudes in this field?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is essential in fields like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cosmology**: modeling galaxy shapes and masses across surveys.\n",
    "* **Gravitational-wave astronomy**: estimating black hole masses while also inferring the astrophysical mass distribution.\n",
    "* **Exoplanets**: learning planet properties *and* the population distribution of their orbits ([Foreman-Mackey et al. 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3020)).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Robust uncertainty propagation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty propagates *through all levels* of the model — from data, to parameters, to hyperparameters. This avoids overconfidence, especially when individual datasets are small or noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *In other words*: we don’t pretend we know the true prior. We learn it from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Taming prior sensitivity**\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with small datasets, inference can be very sensitive to the choice of prior. HBMs address this by **learning the prior from the data itself** — effectively regularizing and reducing bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially important in situations like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rare events (e.g., rocket launches, gravitational wave detections).\n",
    "* Small samples (e.g., exotic galaxies or new transients).\n",
    "* Systematic uncertainties (e.g., unknown noise levels or calibration factors).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus: it’s everywhere in modern astrophysics!\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical models are not just theoretical — they’re now central to many areas of astrophysics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Black hole mergers**: estimate masses/spins of individual events *and* population properties simultaneously ([Moore & Gerosa 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02462), [Taylor & Gerosa 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08365)).\n",
    "* **Weak lensing cosmology**: jointly infer galaxy shapes, redshifts, and cosmological parameters, while marginalizing over nuisance parameters like shear calibration.\n",
    "* **Exoplanet demographics**: learn orbital period and size distributions from Kepler and TESS observations.\n"
