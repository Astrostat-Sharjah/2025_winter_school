    "\n",
    "In the previous sessions we saw examples of parameter estimation for models of one parameter. We also estimated uncertainties, but this required a lot of steps. In this session we will see a general method that can be applied to both simple and complex models, able to naturally provide uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  ### Challenge 1: multiple parameters $\\equiv$ multiple dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "If our model has many parameters, $\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\cdots, \\theta_k$, then the posterior is a $k$-dimensional function.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\cdots, \\theta_k | \\mathrm{Data}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the maximum of a $k$-D function is...way harder than in the 1-D or 2-D cases. Chances are that there are also multiple modes, which may not be found by many optimization algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could try to compute the posterior in a $k$-dimensional **grid** and select the point with the highest posterior. Though, a complex function might have narrow peaks - a high resolution grid might be necessary. The higher the resolution and the number of dimensions, the higher number of evaluations of the posterior - making the computation extremely time consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  ### Challenge 2: uncertainties\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximizing the posterior provides an estimate of the parameter but not its uncertainty. There are approximate solutions to get an estimate of the uncertainty on the parameter, but they usually make an assumption about the shape of the posterior (e.g. Gaussian peak).\n",
    "\n",
    "*  ### Challenge 3: brute-force is non-optimal...\n",
    "\n",
    "Another complication with grids is that we may spend a lot of time at regions of the parameter space where the posterior is low. Instead, we would like to spend more time around the peaks, the regions of high posterior probability.\n",

    "# 2. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique\n",
    "\n",
    "The Marcov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a widely used technique to sample from probability distributions, and therefore likelihoods or posteriors.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is based on the idea of creating a chain of points in the parameter space, using a combination of (i) random walk and (ii) selection of points based on their relative probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm is used to ensure that the chain will reach **equilibrium**: after a number of steps (or length of the Markov chain) the chain will contain points that follow the same distribution, the **target distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It is often characterized as one of the most influencial algorithms of the 20th century...\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Metropolis-Hastings algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, but note that there are *many* others out there. Here are the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We start with one set of parameters $\\theta_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - In our case, $\\theta_1$ is simply $\\alpha$ since we have only one parameter in our model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - In general, $\\theta_1$ can be a vector of 1, 5, or even a million separate parameters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This first value starts our Markov chain.\n",
    "      \n",
    "2. Using **some method** we obtain a new trial set of parameters $\\theta_2$. *A proposition for a new position...*\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - It is important that this set is chosen randomly, but based on the previous set.\n",
    "    - The dependence on only the previous set, is an essential property of a *Markov chain*.\n",
    "    - The randomness is where the *Monte Carlo* in MCMC comes from.\n",
    "    - The simplest method to obtain our new parameter values will be to add some random (Gaussian?) noise to our current value: $\\theta_2 = \\theta_1 + \\epsilon$. This is also called **step size**. You typically want to tune the step size, $\\epsilon$, to optimize the process for a given problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Now, we want to calculate and compare the posterior probabilities for both $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$. If the new parameter is better than the current one,\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$ P(\\theta_2) > P(\\theta_1) $$\n",
    "    we always move the chain to $\\theta_2$. If not, we *might* move to $\\theta_2$ with probability equal to the ratio\n",
    "    $$ \\frac{P(\\theta_2)}{P(\\theta_1)}$$\n",
    "    In practice, we draw a random number from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. If that random number is less than the ratio, we move the chain to $\\theta_2$. Else, we stay at $\\theta_1$ for another iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now that we have our new value for $\\theta$, we return to step 2 and repeat for as many iterations as we want. Often this is in the thousands or more.\n",

However, then the fraction is 0 or 1, then the contribution of one component is minimal, and therefore, its scale is unconstrained. On the other hand, for intermediate values, the two scales converge to the correct value. The \"angle\" in the $a_1$-$a_2$ plot is created by the inequality enforced by the prior.\n",
